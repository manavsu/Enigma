# Enigma

## Introduction

This programming assignment involves building a simulator for a generalized version of the Enigma machine used during World War II for encrypting military communications. The project aims to exercise data structures and object-based programming while simulating the complex encryption mechanisms of the Enigma machine.

## Background

The Enigma machine, developed in the early 20th century, was a revolutionary cryptographic device used by the German military during World War II. It played a pivotal role in securing communications for the Axis powers, employing a complex encryption mechanism that proved challenging for Allied code-breakers.

At its core, the Enigma machine implemented a progressive substitution cipher, where each letter of the alphabet was substituted with another based on the machine's configuration. This permutation was dynamic, changing with each subsequent letter of the message, making decryption considerably more difficult.

The device comprised interchangeable rotors (Walzen) and reflectors (Umkehrwalzen) arranged on a shaft, each implementing a different permutation of signals. The rotors, which had 26 contacts on both sides, could rotate after encrypting a letter, further altering the encryption pattern. The reflectors, positioned to the left of the rotors, directed signals back through the rotors in reverse, ensuring a derangement of letters.

The configuration of the Enigma machine, including the selection and order of rotors and reflectors, as well as their initial rotational settings, constituted the secret key used for encryption and decryption. For instance, the German Navy used a machine with 12 rotors and five slots for them, offering a vast number of possible configurations.

To enhance security, the Enigma machine also incorporated a plugboard (Steckerbrett), allowing operators to configure additional substitutions by connecting pairs of letters with cables. This plugboard acted as a non-moving, configurable rotor, further complicating the encryption process.

Despite its cryptographic strength, the Enigma machine was not without vulnerabilities. Code-breakers, notably Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park, employed innovative techniques to decipher intercepted Enigma-encrypted messages, ultimately contributing to the Allied victory in World War II.

Today, the Enigma machine stands as a symbol of cryptography and the enduring battle between encryption and decryption, showcasing the importance of secure communication in the face of adversity.
